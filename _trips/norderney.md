  Our aircrafts in Norderney
---

Every 3 months, the flight schools organizes a "theme flight". The first one I took part in was a "Bounty flight" to a German island called Norderney. I only had about 6 hours on my logbook, enough to cover the first part about familiarizing with the aircraft.

Instead of a regular lesson, we converted that Sunday to a navigation flight.
It has been very exciting to decide the waypoints and prepare the whole flight plan.
And even more, to actually flight the two legs to Nordernay and back.
The experience of flying while continuously navigate and update the flight schedule sure is overwhelming the first time, but I had such a great time.

The weather that day was not that great, but this didn't stop us, fortunately.

This, by the way, was also the very first time I recorded a flight with my new GoPro, bought for the occasion.
