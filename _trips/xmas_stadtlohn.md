The flight school organized another "theme flight" in the cold month of December. This time we went to visit the Christmas market of a small German village called Vreden, which is located at 7 km distance from the airport of Stadtlohn (EDLS) and very close to the Dutch border.

For the way there I chose a route that would allow us to track the Rekken VOR, in order for me to try a radio navigation aid for the first time.

For the way back I selected a different path. The idea was to fly near Apeldoorn and, if my calculations were correct, we would see the "Paleis Het Loo" from above.

We all had a lot of fun and look forward to the next adventure!
