The weekend after my birthday I went to the airport with my girlfriend and my mother, convinced of having yet-another-lesson about touch-and-gos.
Instead, when we got there, my instructor started to show them the aircrafts, and had them to sit inside a Cessna 172 (4 seater) "to get a feel of how it is to be in one of those aircraft".
And once they were inside and latched they seatbels (and I was gettin a bit impatient, other than confused, because I wanted to have my lesson to fly), the instructor, who had an agreement with my girlfriend, said: "Let's go for a ride with this one!".

*Surprise!* I was with my family, piloting my favorite aircraft, headed to Texel, a lovely dutch island North of Amsterdam. I couldn't believe this!

The weather was awesome, there was practically no turbulence. We landed on the grass strip of EHTX and had lunch there, where also many skydivers were coming down of the sky.
It was an incredible experience.
