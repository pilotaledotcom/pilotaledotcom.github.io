  The desk in my hotel room, after passing all 9 exams

Since I'm doing my PPL in The Netherlands, and here the exams in the Ensligh language are not yet implemented (I don't speak Dutch - YET!), my flight school recommended me a Ground School in United Kingdom which offers an intensive theory course and exams. It was a very fun experience! In 4 days I attended 9 courses and took 9 exams (one at the end of each session). Though not required, I had read the theory books in the previous months, before going there. This helped me a lot to get very good grades. Also, the group of students was fantastic: we used to go out for beers and food every evening, the environment was very sociable. Also, one night (after the hardest exam of Flight Planning & Performance) our instructor invited us to a very good and fancy asian restaurant. It was delicious and the conversation was very interesting (I don't have many occasions to speak so much about aviation with friends). Before leaving, we made sure we exchanged our contacts to stay in touch, so that we can share news from time to time about our progress. Another thing I liked about the experience was the city: Harrogate offers a lot of cozy restaurants, pubs, and hotels (The Crown Hotel, for example, which was where I slept)
