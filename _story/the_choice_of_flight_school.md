title: The choice of the flight school

I think it is worth taking some time to choose the flight school that best suits your needs. I found that there was a good number of schools here in The Netherlands, so this gave me the opportunity to choose based on my requirements. For example, the most important factors for my choice were:

The transparency of the school
The availability (response time, available slots for lessons, ...)
The fleet (do they have Cessna airplanes? <3)
The proximity to the airport where the school operated
Probably the most important factor for me was the transparency: I was looking for a school which would give me all the information I needed upfront and which would help me understand all the expenses I should expect to incur. At the end I chose to take lessons from "aiRFÃ¼rste" in Lelystad, because of the great communication I had regarding costs and other very useful information. At the end of our phone conversation I scheduled a trial lesson of one hour.
