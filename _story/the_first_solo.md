  My very first landing ;)

Once I was back from the UK, my confidence was even more boosted, which made me feel even more capable of flying that airplane down to the runway. There were a few things to fine-tune, for example the lack of right rudder on takeoff, causing a drift towards left, and my flare: sometimes I was flaring too much, sometimes not enonugh. But eventually my instructor started to be more and more quiet, which meant I was getting better and better.

One day (30/10/2016) I was driving to the airport for my lessons and I noticed the wind turbines were almost still. So I thought "calm wind today, would be nice to have my first solo, if only I was ready.....". I arrived at the airport, I started checking and refueling the a/c in autonomy. I kept on thinking how "almost ready" I was, and that I had to try to do as much as I could proactively withouth waiting for any hint by my instructor. We departed, I went through the usual checklists, I lined up onto runway 23, and made a couple of circuits. The instructor never said a word. He only told me to make a full-stop landing after the third landing. After vacating the runway he asked me how I thought it went. Since he hasn't spoken throughout all the lessons I assumed it went well. "It's quite boring, isn't it?" he asked me. "No, it's fun as usual", I think I replied - starting to understand what was going on. "Would you like to make your solo?". I replied with a confident "Yes!". So I taxied to the tower, where he gave me a signed endorsement, advised me to take my time and do everything the same way I did so far and he stepped out of the a/c. My only question before he left was: "You have a radio, don't you?", but I already knew the answer, I was just a bit nervous.

I went through my checklists, taxied to the engine run-up area, performend the engine run-up checks, lined up and departed. Once in the air the tension dropped, because after all it was about performing the same procedures that I was already doing with my instructor on board, only that this time he wasn't there and the aircraft climbed a bit faster. I did two touch-and-gos and one full stop landing. It's been incredible. I will never forget that day. And I couldn't stop smiling :)
