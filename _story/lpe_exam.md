  Me, before taking the LPE exam
---

On 07/11/2016 I took my Language Proficiency Examination (LPE) exam. The purpose of this exam is to ensure that the student is able to communicate in plain English with ATC. There are six levels you can achieve (1 to 6), where the minimum "pass" level (to achieve ICAO compliance) is 4. The final achieved level determines the duration of the cerfificate. With a level 4, the exam needs to be taken again after 4 years. With level 5, after 6 years and with level 6 the exam does not need to be retaken. The final level is determined by the lowest level achieved in the exercises.
