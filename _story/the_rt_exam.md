  Radio of a Cessna 150

Now that I was flying circuits, I also had to learn how to use the radio properly. Therefore I started a weekly course with aiRFÃ¼rste, where I could practice all the aviation jargon and procedures. During each lesson I was simulating a couple of flights, which I could prepare in advance, and it was real fun to pretend that I was departing from Schiphol, requesting a start up approval, take off clearance etc. All of this from my computer at home (or from a hotel room in Mallorca, in the case of the exam, as I was on vacation).
