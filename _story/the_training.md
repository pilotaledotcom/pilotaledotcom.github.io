  A second before the stall. Guess what's about to happen ;)

  A touch-and-go, during my circuit training

13/03/2016. The first trial lesson was about familiarizing with the a/c: climbs, descents, turns and straight and level flight. It goes without saying that it was awesome!

The next series of lessons were about the same manuvres, only covered in more depth (every lesson dedicated to one of these aspects of the flight). Each lesson is accompanied by a pre flight briefing and a debriefing after the flight. It's nice to learn what's behind the physics of an aircraft, for example which aerodynamic forces interact with it in every manuvre and the relationship between them at the various stages of the flight.

After this block of basic lessons, it was time for a progress test, which simply consists of the same manuvres from above, repeated and combined in a single lesson to make sure those are drilled in the student's brain. Then a transition phase began, where a few lessons were focused on the safety of the flight. In fact, before starting to deal with take offs and landings, the syllabus includes a few procedures aimed at developping the ability to recognize promptly dangerous stituations and getting out of them. In these lessons I could learn the effects of slow flight. Then we moved on to practicing Stall Recovery and Spin Avoidance. IT'S INTENSE! If you don't know what I'm talking about, make a quick research on Youtube, trying to imagine the G forces involved during the moment in which the aircraft stalls and its nose dips down :)

Fianally after this set of sessions we moved on to a very exciting phase: circuit training, where you fly dozens of circuits around the home airport to learn how the landing patterns work and, well... how to take off and land. This is very interesting, not only because the exercise included all aspects of flight previously practiced (climbs, descents, turns, slow flight), but also because it becomes a transition period where I could notice my progress: I was becoming more and more proficient, autonomous and confident. This was also a very important phase because, as I was mastering the procedures, the moment of my first solo flight was getting closer. But before telling you about this, I must also tell you about my RT exam and my Theory exams.
