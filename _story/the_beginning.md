I have always had a passion for motors and driving any type of vehicle, and I pretty much did drive various vehicles in my life: bikes, mopeds, scooters, cars, motorbikes, motorboats, even tandem bike and segway.

I was still a kid when I had my very first flight on a General Aviation aircraft (I think it was a Cessna 172): I was sitting in the front seat and the instructor let me to try to use the controls once we were in the air. I am very grateful to my father for having givend me that incredible experience.

Since then I have dreamt about flying. But it was only when I reached 29 yeard old that I actually started taking flight lessons. A couple of gifts from my friends triggered my decision: a flight experience on a Cessna 172 and a flight simulator experience. Both were amazing! So I decided: "I want to get a Private Pilot License".

The first step for me has been to decide which type of Pilot License to go for. But this was an easy decision, after having done some research. Basically, you get the most "privileges" with a Private Pilot License (PPL), as it allows to bring on board more passengers and to fly an Arircraft (a/c) with a higher Maximum Take Off Weight with respect to a RPL (The "R" stands for recreational). It was an easy decision in my case because at this stage the chioce was basically PPL vs. RPL vs. LAPL (microlights). Other licenses such as CPL and ATPL are for commercial aviation and require you to hold a PPL already.

The following step was obtaining a Medical Certificate: I wanted to be sure I was fit for flying before starting my lessons, just to avoid any potential disappointment. I went for a Class 2 Medical Certificate which is the minimum required for a PPL holder. However, if you're considering to fly commercial, it is strongly advised to apply for a Class 1 from the beginning, and the reason is the same: you want to make sure you're physically fit, before committing to very high expenses and in order to avoid disappointment.

Once I succesfully obtained my medical certificate, on 22/02/2016, I was finally ready to start taking flight lessons!
